# Data - P2P

The [P2P data format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerGuardian#P2P_plaintext_format) is the original format for PeerGuardian version 1.x and can be used with [PeerBlock](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock), [PeerGuardian](http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerguardian/), [iplist](http://iplist.sourceforge.net/) and many others.

You can integrate data specifically generated in the P2P format by copying the content of a `.txt` file located in [`data/p2p`](../../data/p2p).

Here is an example with PeerBlock and the data from `data/p2p/spy.txt`:
